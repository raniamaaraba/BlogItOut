        "Components included the Adafruit LSM6DSO32 IMU for gyroscope data and as an accelerometer. This was then recorded in G's across all axes and angular velocity in degrees per second, to allow for the analysis of thrust, stability, and stage changes. MS5611 Barometer was used to temperature and pressure. From pressure readings, we could then calculate altitude both to sea level and to the launch site in Dayton, pinpointing apogee and descent. The ESP32 Microcontroller acted as the whole brain of the operation, running flight detection logic, managing data storage, and hosting a local server we could manage for continuity.",
        "Harty Darty was a large group effort by UCRO to create a boosted dart with Mach 1 capabilities. The goals of the avionics team was to create a fully custom avionics as well as an additional fall-back bay using the Blue Raven developed by Featherweight Altimiters. Harty Darty had a semi-sucessful launch on November 23nd with a delayed separation stage (it is important to know ths is a boosted dart, so the second stage did not contain a motor and was purily thrusted by the intial thrust and drag separation). ",
        "Being the second avionics project I've had the opportunity to work on, it was very rewarding to see the final project yet very difficult encoutering unknown waters. Majority of my projects have been local apps and website so encorperating hardware was pretty much entierly new to me as well as understanding fundamentals of electroncis and enacted forces. I have learned a lot more about hardware and software development incoorperation, CAD, wiring, working with a team for the greater good."

        "Using a 4 in diamater on a J-800 motor, the Open Rocket simulation is predicted for the rocket to achieve an apogee of 4,900ft with a max velocity of over 1,000 ft/s. The entire rocket except for the fins are made of re-enforced cardboard with a 3D printed custom avionics bay.",
        "Currently looking to launch at the beginning of December--and have had many trials and tribulations along the way! After achieving my Jr Level 1 (now just Level 1) back in the fall of 2021, there was quite a bit I needed to re-learn about development of a new rocket with an unfamiliar matieral. Unlike my time previously working on our Harty Darty Rocket (go read it!!), my avionics bay this time was completely on my own and luckily was loaned components from the club to use. Although I have previously worked on physical impelemntation with a breadboard and understanding the fundamentals of wiring, this proved to be still a skill I want to work harder at with my lack of understanding and efficency. In addition, developing a electronics bay using Fusion 360 was entirely new and as I am sure Landry could atest, I am quite poor at. Half of the journey is learning what you don't know and this was a beautiful example of new skills that I want to improve on. This flight isn’t just a test. It’s a celebration of everything I’ve learned so far, and a launchpad for what comes next. Level 3 may be on the horizon, but right now, it’s all about the thrill of the high altitude, craziness of a launch day, and a quite a bit of adrenaline."
